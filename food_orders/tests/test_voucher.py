Pytest Tests for Voucher Logic
================================================================================

This file contains tests for the voucher creation, application, and pausing
logic, written using the pytest framework.

Key Pytest Concepts Used:
-------------------------
- **Fixtures**: Reusable functions (`@pytest.fixture`) that set up a specific
  state or object for tests (e.g., creating a participant or a voucher setting).
  Tests declare which fixtures they need as arguments, and pytest handles
  running them. This replaces the old `setUp` methods.

- **Markers**: Labels (`@pytest.mark`) that can be applied to tests. We use
  `@pytest.mark.django_db` to tell pytest that a test needs database access.

- **Plain `assert` Statements**: Instead of `self.assertEqual(a, b)`, pytest uses
  the simple `assert a == b`. This provides more detailed and readable output
  on failure.

- **Factory Integration**: These tests directly use the factories defined in
  `food_orders.utils.test_helpers` to create model instances, centralizing
  test data creation.
