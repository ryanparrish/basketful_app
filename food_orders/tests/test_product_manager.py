"""
Tests for meat weight limit rules in the food_orders app.

These tests validate business logic that enforces maximum allowable weight
for meat products within an order. By using `_validate_order_logic` instead
of Django formsets, the suite focuses on core domain rules rather than form
plumbing. This ensures that:
- Orders exceeding the meat weight cap are invalidated with clear errors.
- Orders within the limit remain valid.
- Non-meat products are unaffected by meat weight constraints.
- Edge cases (zero quantity, multiple meat products) are consistently enforced.

This file is intended for product managers and developers to verify that
critical order validation rules behave deterministically under different
scenarios, regardless of how orders are created (form, API, import).
